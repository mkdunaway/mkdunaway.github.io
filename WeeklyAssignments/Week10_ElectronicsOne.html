            We only have two more weeks of assignments until we get to the Final Project. Thus far, you have learned 
            to use a variety of tools but you haven't combined multiple tools to create one finished product. Though the final
            project page isn't fully built out, you can see some of the requirements for the final project <a class="bodylin" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b1yJd4u7DfIgZYfM842bUGYvP5SjJouGSphCn8_SncM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. The goal of the
            the next two weeks is to experience making a semi finished product using multiple materials, tools, and softwares.
            In that way, the next two weeks will feel very different.

                    In the lab, there is a finished version of the final product by the heat press. I highly encourage you to check it out and physically
                    see how it is assembled (this will be super helpful for all the visual and tactile learners our there). 
                </p>

                <p class="bodyParagraph">
                    There are a few files we have fully prepped for you. The rest of the files you will create on your own.
                    There are four main components to this project each with their own parameters: laser cut acrylic sign, laser cut wooden 
                    housing electronic and acrylic housing, 3D printed exterior container, CNC routed and soldered electronic board. 
                </p>

                <ol class="bodyNumList">
                    <li>Laser cut acrylic sign: Use Adobe Illustrator to create
                        a unique design. There are three layers in the file you will download. Note that
                         your text must be mirrored and you will use 1/8 inch acrylic. <a class="bodylin" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T9vHp3Gu7ZofYH195V8kzDWbmtYezi3p/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Download acrylic file here</a>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Laser cut wooden housing electronic and acrylic housing: These files have been fully designed for you
                        so all you need to do is laser cut them. <a class="bodylin" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pl_J0xwOf0MFr7Ng4v-lQpLi7wiFBra3/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Download wood file here</a>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>3D printed exterior container: This will likely be the most challenging part. You need to design (in Fusion 360) and
                        print a snug exterior which holds all of these components using the measurments you already have.
                        It will likely take you a few tries as it needs to tighly hold the innder wooden laser cut components, the acrylic sign, 
                        and have an opening for the power chord.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>CNC routed and soldered electronic board: This multi step part will be covered in a training. Unlike
                        our other trainings, this will be a two person training and you should complete this entire component
                        in the training. 
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p class="bodyParagraph">
                    While you have dabbled with creating designs that rely on other components (the 3D printed planter that
                    fit into the CNC routed desk organizer), you haven't been challenged to design a product with multiple
                     components that are all interdependent.
