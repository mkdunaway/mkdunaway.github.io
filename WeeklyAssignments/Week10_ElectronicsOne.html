            We only have two more weeks of assignments until we get to the Final Project. Thus far, you have learned 
            to use a variety of tools but you haven't combined multiple tools to create one finished product. Though the final
            project page isn't fully built out, you can see some of the requirements for the final project <a class="bodylin" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b1yJd4u7DfIgZYfM842bUGYvP5SjJouGSphCn8_SncM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. The goal of the
            the next eight days is to experience making a semi finished product using multiple materials, tools, and softwares.
            While you have dabbled with creating designs that rely on other components (the 3D printed planter that
            fit into the CNC routed desk organizer), you haven't been challenged to design a product with multiple
            components that are all interdependent. In that way, really the rest of the class will feel different. You will need to act almost similar to a project 
            manager; constantly considering constraints, timeline, design implications, etc. Also note that unlike prior weeks, 
            there is no more regrading moving forward. Also note that this due date is a different day of the week.

                    Sign up for an Electronics training session. This is not in the usual place. Go to "Book Workshops" on the
                     left nav bar, then to "Digital Lab", then to the training. There are a 20 trainings and 18 of you.
                    Please make it a priority to sign up now as there is little wiggle room. The trainings are in the Digital Lab
                    in Meneely 201.

                    In the lab, there is an (almost) finished version of the final product by the heat press. I highly encourage you to check it out and physically
                    see how it is assembled (this will be super helpful for all the visual and tactile learners our there).

                    There are a few files we have fully prepped for you. The rest of the files you will create on your own.
                    There are four main components to this project each with their own parameters: laser cut acrylic sign, laser cut wooden 
                    housing electronic and acrylic housing, 3D printed exterior container, precision milled and soldered electronic board connected to
                    neo pixels.

                <ol class="bodyNumList">
                    <li>Laser cut acrylic sign: Use Adobe Illustrator to create
                        a unique design. There are three layers in the file you will download. Note that
                         your text must be mirrored and you will use 1/8 inch acrylic. <a class="bodylin" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T9vHp3Gu7ZofYH195V8kzDWbmtYezi3p/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Download acrylic file here</a>

                    <br>
                    <li>Laser cut wooden housing electronic and acrylic housing: These files have been fully designed for you
                        so all you need to do is laser cut them. <a class="bodylin" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pl_J0xwOf0MFr7Ng4v-lQpLi7wiFBra3/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Download wood file here</a>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>3D printed exterior container: This will likely be the most challenging part. You need to design (in Fusion 360) and
                        print a snug exterior which holds all of these components using the measurements you already have.
                        It will likely take you a few tries as it needs to tightly hold the inner wooden laser cut components, the acrylic sign, 
                        and have an opening for the power chord. You will be partially graded on how well this fits and holds the
                        components. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Precision milled and soldered electronic board: This multi step part will be covered in a training. Unlike
                        our other trainings, this will be a two person training and you should complete this entire component
                        in the training. 
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    These will be displayed at our gallery opening. Good luck!
